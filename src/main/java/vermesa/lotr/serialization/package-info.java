/**
 * Package representing serialization of external configuration of a Game.
 * Since the game state is so complex and making custom configuration easily
 * is a huge advantage, the game configuration is mostly parsed from external resources.
 *
 * <p>
 *     The interface to implement a custom external configuration is {@link vermesa.lotr.serialization.IGameConfig}
